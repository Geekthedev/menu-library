## Overview

This project uses the **[Menu Animation Library](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Geekthedev/menu-library@main/menu-library/js/menu-library.js)** hosted on **JSDelivr** to create various animated menus. The menus include simple slide-ins, fades, pop-up animations, and other transitions, making it easier to add modern, interactive menu designs to your website.

The menus can be customized and integrated into your projects with minimal code changes. This `README.md` explains how to set up and use these animations effectively.

## Features

- **Multiple Menu Styles**: Slide, fade, pop, overlay, dropdown, modal, push, rotational, and morph.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each menu has a dedicated button to trigger the animation effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimal Setup**: Easily integrate the styles and functionality into any webpage.

---

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need the following:

1. **HTML file**: The base structure of the webpage, where the menus will be displayed.
2. **External CSS**: The library that provides predefined styles for various menu types.
3. **External JavaScript**: A library to handle the menu animations.

### Step 1: Download or Clone the Repository

You can either clone this repository or download the ZIP file to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/menu-animation-library.git
```

### Step 2: Link External CSS and JS

In your HTML file, ensure that you link the external CSS and JavaScript files from **JSDelivr**. Here's how:

- **CSS**: Use the following link in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Geekthedev/menu-library@main/menu-library/menu-styles.css">
  ```

- **JavaScript**: Use the following script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag:

  ```html
  <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Geekthedev/menu-library@main/menu-library/js/menu-library.js"></script>
  ```

### Step 3: Add HTML Markup

Use the provided HTML structure in the `index.html` to create various types of menus. The sample HTML includes buttons for triggering different animated menus and containers to hold the menus themselves.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the buttons to trigger different animations for the menus. Each menu has a corresponding button to open it, and the library will take care of the animation transitions.

Hereâ€™s how to open each menu:

1. **Slide Menu**: Opens from the left, sliding in the menu content.
2. **Fade Menu**: Fades in the menu content.
3. **Pop Menu**: Pops in from the center.
4. **Overlay Menu**: A full-screen overlay menu that slides in.
5. **Dropdown Menu**: Displays the menu content in a dropdown style.
6. **Modal Menu**: A modal-style menu that opens centered on the screen.
7. **Push Menu**: The content is pushed to one side while the menu appears.
8. **Rotational Menu**: Rotates to display the menu.
9. **Morph Menu**: The menu morphs into the desired shape during the animation.

Each menu can be customized by changing the `data-menu` attribute in the button element. You can also adjust the `data-duration` attribute to change the speed of the animations.

## Menu Styles

This project comes with several predefined animated menu styles that can be customized further to fit your needs. Below is a brief overview of each menu style:

1. **Slide**: This menu slides in from the left side of the screen.
2. **Fade**: This menu fades into view, providing a subtle transition effect.
3. **Pop**: This menu pops up from the center, drawing attention to itself.
4. **Overlay**: This style takes over the entire screen, displaying the menu in an overlay format.
5. **Dropdown**: The menu content drops down from the top or bottom.
6. **Modal**: A modal window that appears centered on the screen, typically used for critical interactions.
7. **Push**: The content of the page is pushed to one side while the menu comes in from the other side.
8. **Rotational**: The menu rotates into place, offering a unique animated effect.
9. **Morph**: This menu morphs into the required position or shape.

Each menu type has its own class in the provided CSS file, which is automatically applied when the button is clicked.

## Customization

You can further customize the menu styles by adjusting the following attributes in the HTML file:

- **Direction of Slide Menus**: Change the `data-direction` attribute in the button to control whether the slide menu comes from the left, right, top, or bottom.
- **Animation Duration**: Use the `data-duration` attribute to adjust how quickly the menu animates. The value is in milliseconds (e.g., 300 for 0.3 seconds).
- **Menu Content**: Modify the `<ul class="menu-list">` to add or remove items, or adjust the design of the links inside.
